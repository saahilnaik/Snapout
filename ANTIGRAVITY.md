# ANTIGRAVITY.md — SnapOut Project Context

## What is this?
SnapOut is an Android app that intercepts app launches and shows a 3-breath breathing intervention before letting the user proceed. Built with Flutter, targeting Indian Gen Z.
Pricing: free (1 app) + **SnapOut Pro** unlock at ₹499/year or ₹799 lifetime (real prices will come from Google Play Console via `in_app_purchase`).

## Architecture
- Flutter 3.44 (stable). Riverpod 3.x (state), GoRouter (nav), Hive (storage).
- **Riverpod 3.x**: use `Notifier`/`NotifierProvider` — `StateNotifier` is deprecated/removed.
- MVVM: `lib/features/{feature}/{view,viewmodel,model}`; shared code in `lib/core/{services,theme,router,widgets,utils}` + `lib/core/providers.dart`.
- **Native bridge (Android, built):** Kotlin `DetectionService` (foreground service) polls `UsageStatsManager` (~0.8s) for the foreground app; on a protected package it launches `MainActivity` with route `/breathing?live=1&pkg=<package>`. `MainActivity` exposes a MethodChannel `snapout/detection` (permissions, start/stop service, goHome, moveToBack, consumeLaunchRoute) and EventChannel `snapout/events` (detections). `BootReceiver` resumes after reboot. Kotlin lives in `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/snapout/snapout/`.

## Key Files
- `lib/core/services/detection_service.dart` — Dart side of the native bridge.
- `lib/core/services/protected_apps_store.dart` / `stats_store.dart` — Hive persistence.
- `lib/core/providers.dart` — `detectionServiceProvider`, `protectedAppsProvider`, `statsProvider`.
- `lib/features/intervention/view/breathing_screen.dart` — the intervention.
- `android/.../DetectionService.kt`, `MainActivity.kt`, `BootReceiver.kt`.

## Current State (Progress)
1. ✅ Scaffold + dark theme + GoRouter + Hive.
2. ✅ UI polish: design system/tokens, all screens (home/onboarding/stats/settings), bottom-nav shell, adaptive icon + splash.
3. ✅ Breathing screen: smooth sinusoidal lung-style orb (grows on inhale / shrinks on exhale, computed per-frame), aura + glow, haptics, decision buttons, back blocked.
4. ✅ Phase 2 detection: protected app opens → breathing fires over it; 30s cooldown. Onboarding uses a real `installed_apps` picker + permission gating; service auto-resumes on app start.
5. ✅ Decision behavior + real stats: skip → launcher (+log skip), open → reveal app (+log open); Home/Stats show live data (skips, streak, minutes saved, weekly bars).
6. ⏳ IAP + Pro: `in_app_purchase` (annual product: `snapout_pro_annual` at ₹499/year, lifetime product: `snapout_pro_lifetime` at ₹799 lifetime). real Play buy/restore wired. Debug-only unlock in debug builds. (Note: pricing transition from ₹149 single tier to ₹499/yr + ₹799 lifetime in progress).
7. ✅ Reminders: daily local notification (flutter_local_notifications + timezone), Settings sheet (switch + time picker), Hive-persisted; reschedules on reboot. Task-stack fix: main dedupes the `/breathing` push by path so repeated detections don't stack screens.
8. ✅ Light/dark/system theme: `AppColors` surfaces+text are mutable, `applyTheme(Brightness)` swaps them, `accentSoft` is a translucent accent. `themeModeProvider` (Hive) + Settings Theme picker; reacts to OS brightness in system mode. NOTE: widgets read static `AppColors` (no Theme dependency), so the app root **re-keys MaterialApp on brightness/accent** to force a full rebuild (incl. go_router's cached shell). When adding chrome that must recolor, rely on that rekey, not Theme.of.

NOT built yet: iOS, Play Console publishing. Backlog: bundle real fonts (Clash/Satoshi), 30-day stats view. Firebase setup is postponed to later stages.

Known rough edge: repeated triggers can leave the SnapOut/breathing task stacked oddly when re-entering from the launcher — pop the breathing route fully on dismiss in a polish pass.

## Design Rules
- Dark default, neon lime (`#BFFF00`) accent used sparingly. Tokens in `lib/core/theme/app_tokens.dart`; theme in `app_theme.dart`.
- Aesthetic: professional, minimal, Gen-Z. Generous whitespace, smooth subtle motion.
- Bold type. Target fonts Clash Display / Satoshi (Fontshare) — currently Space Grotesk via `google_fonts` as a stand-in (google_fonts only serves the Google catalog; bundle the real fonts as local assets later).
- No serif fonts. No blue/purple gradients. No corporate feel.

## Code Rules
- Dart null safety; keep `flutter analyze` clean (lint enforces braces on flow control).
- Prefer Riverpod providers for app state; `setState` is fine for local widget animation (e.g. the breath controller).
- Platform-channel calls: catch `PlatformException` where failure is plausible.
- Intervention: back disabled until breaths done; dismiss only via the two buttons.
- Hive: `StatsStore`/`ProtectedAppsStore` guard against an unopened box and never mutate the list returned by a getter (it may be `const []`).

## Build / Run
- Android only. `minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 35`, `compileSdk 36` (`android/app/build.gradle.kts`); compileSdk 36 + core-library desugaring required by some plugins.
- Project at `C:\dev\snapout` (NO spaces — Android Gradle breaks on spaces). Flutter SDK at `C:\dev\flutter`. `flutter run` with a connected device.
- Test device: physical phone — emulators are unreliable for usage stats.
- Repo: https://github.com/saahilnaik/Snapout (branch `main`).
